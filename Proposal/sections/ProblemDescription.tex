\section{Problem Description}
Ci is a form of poetry, arisen with the so called banquet music in Tang dynasty. After about hundred years, it reached its peak in Song dynasty and became a major alternative to shi poetry\cite{cai2008chinesepoetry}.\\

Although unlike the even line structure used in shi, ci is still has strict rule determining number of characters for different lines, the arrangement of rhyme, and the location of tones. There are more than 800 rule sets for ci, which is called cipai\cite{wikici}. The author of ci need to filling in the words according to the matrix associated to the cipai. The uneven line used empower ci to use more continuous syntax that traditional shi\cite{cai2008chinesepoetry}.
