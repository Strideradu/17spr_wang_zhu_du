\begin{abstract}
In this project, we are going to develop a poem generator for Ci poetry. A system based on recurrent neural network (RNN) will be implemented to solve the sequence-to-sequence learning problem. We also will compare to the traditional method that used to generate poem. We hope that our system can learn the complete rule from training dataset without any given constraints. And can generate complex meaningful syntax that following the special rules for rhyme and tone in the Ci.
