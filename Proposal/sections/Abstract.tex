\begin{abstract}
In this project, we aim to develop a poem generator for Chinese Song Ci poetry. We will implement a  system based on recurrent neural network (RNN) to solve the sequence-to-sequence learning problem. We also will compare our approach with conventional poem generation methods. We hope that our system can learn the complete rule from a comprehensive training set without any given constraints, and can generate complex meaningful syntax that following the special rules for rhyme and tone in Song Ci.
