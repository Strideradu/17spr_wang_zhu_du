\begin{abstract}
In this project, we are going to develop a poem generator for Ci poetry. A system based on recurrent neural network (RNN) will be implemented to solve the sequence-to-sequence learning problem. We will also compare the performance of this model with the traditional automatic method that used to generate poem. We hope that our system can learn the complete rule from training dataset without any given constraints and generate poems with meaningful syntax that following the special rules for rhyme and tone in the Ci.
