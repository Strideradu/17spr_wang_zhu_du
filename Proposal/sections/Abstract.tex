In this project, we are going to develop a poem generator for Ci poetry. A system based on recurrent neural network (RNN) will be implemented to solve the sequence-to-sequence learning problem. We will also compare the performance of this model with the traditional automatic method that used to generate poem. We hope that our system can learn the complete rule from training dataset without any given constraints and generate poems with meaningful syntax that following the special rules for rhyme and tone in the Ci.

In this project, we aim to develop a poem generator for Chinese Song Ci poetry. We will implement a  system based on recurrent neural network (RNN) to solve the sequence-to-sequence learning problem. We also will compare our approach with conventional poem generation methods. We hope that our system can learn the complete rule from a comprehensive training set without any given constraints, and can generate complex meaningful syntax that following the special rules for rhyme and tone in Song Ci.
