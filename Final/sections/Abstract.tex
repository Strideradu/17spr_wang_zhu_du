Song Ci is a precious cultural heritage of China, which is various in styles and sophisticated in syntactic rules.
%
In this project, we propose and implement a models to automatically generate Chinese Song Ci using Recurrent Neural Network.
%
Before training our models, we use a vector space model to convert each Chinese character as a vector which still reserves the semantic relevance among different characters.
%
Then we use the vector presentation as the model inputs.
%
We also implement Long Short Term Memory units (LSTMs) into the RNN model to learn the semantic meaning in long-distance.
  %
We will compare the performance of the RNN  with two different models: a traditional Genetic Algorithm model, and  a Generative Adversarial Network model, respectively.
%
We hope that our approaches can learn the complete rule from training corpus without any given constraints, and can generate elegant Song Ci poems that follow syntax rules.
