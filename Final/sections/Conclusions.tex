\section{Conclusion and Future Work} 
\judy{To be contniued}


To further improve the qualities of generation, we can adopt the knowledge based method that can incorporate extra sources of knowledges. Previews work \cite{wang2016baidu} showed that by using extract knowledges from encyclopedia, the RNNs model can write the poem in topic which cannot find in the ancient Chinese poems. 

Also, a systematic evaluation is necessary to rate each model. Popular automatic evaluation method, like BLEU, cannot provide a comprehensive metric as human evaluation\cite{iu2016evaluate}. For this reason, we may need to organize human evaluation to evaluate all the results generated by our models.

Finally, RNNs has various structures and we may benefit from advanced RNN models. For example, attention-based RNN and Lookback RNN \cite{lookbackRNN} already prove it can efficiently generate musics. These models should further improve the results.
